# Period Buddy

#### We created this project for Give Back Hacks 2.0 organized by MLH. Our Devpost [Submission](https://devpost.com/software/period-buddy).

# Inspiration

Coming from India, "period" is taboo for most people, even for the educated ones. It was always in our mind to take some steps towards making it a socially and culturally acceptable topic. Also, it is hard to find apps related to periods in native Indian languages.

## What it does

It has features like -

- Finding your period buddies i.e. your friends who have their periods with you. Your buddies would be the only ones with whom we'll share your data, ie with your approval.
- Know how to support someone during their periods, could be your significant other, best friends or anyone you want

## How we built it

We used Firebase for backend and native android and react (web) as front end.

## Challenges we ran into

- Getting a female perspective
- Finding a way to hold our user's personal data securely.
- Getting trustable resources regarding periods
- Integrating firebase with both android and react

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Creating a complete solution with backend, android, and web.
- Created something to give back to the community

## What we learned

- As men, it's impossible to understand what periods feel like.
- How to integrate firebase with frontend and use firestore database

## What's next for Period Buddy

- First to complete the frontend and backend integration
- Add support for our native languages like Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Bengali, Panjabi, etc
